  <p>When will the iPhone Omnipod 5 App be released? Who knows! Insulet announced in October of 2023 that the iOS app to control the Omnipod 5 from your iPhone had received FDA clearance and would launch sometime in 2024 apparently. A reasonable person would think having been announced a couple of months before the new year that the app would be launching toward the beginning of 2024.  That was apparently not the case. Given a launch window of the entire year, it sounds like they have no idea when or if they'll actually release it.</p>
